## Prerequisites

Before using this repository, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** – version **22.x** or later  
  [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

- **npm** – version **10.x** or later (comes with Node.js)

- **pnpm** – version **10.10** or later

## Installation

Install all dependencies for the repository:

```bash
rush install
```

This will install dependencies for all workspaces in the monorepo.

## Building the Monorepo

To build all packages:

```bash
rush build
```

This uses a local build cache, so only changed packages are rebuilt.

### Building a Single Workspace

To build a specific package:

```bash
rush build --to <package-name>
```

Replace `<package-name>` with the name of the package you want to build.

Example:
```bash
rush build --to @wso2/ballerina-visualizer
```

### Adding a New Package

To add a new package:

1. Navigate to the root directory of the desired package:
    ```bash
    cd <path-to-workspace>
    ```
2. Run:
    ```bash
    rush add --package <package-name>
    ```
   Use the `-m` argument to update other packages' `package.json` files to the same version if needed.

## Other Important Commands

- `rush update`: Updates the dependencies shrinkwrap file.
- `rush rebuild`: Cleans the `common/temp` folder and then runs `rush build`.
- `rush check`: Checks dependency consistency across packages.
- `rush purge`: Cleans up temporary files and folders.
