      non-compliance is discovered in an audit, Subscriber will be responsible for 
      all costs associated with carrying out such audit. In addition, where 
      such audit reveals Subscriber has exceeded the usage subscribed-for, Subscriber 
      shall pay WSO2 prorated fees for the excess usage at the same rate(s) 
      designated in the most proximate Order. If the date excess usage began cannot 
      be determined to WSO2's satisfaction, excess usage shall be deemed to

      employed or engaged by the other party and who was involved in the provision 
      or receipt of Services under this Agreement until one hundred eighty (180) 
      calendar days following the termination of the person's or entity's 
      employment or engagement with the other party. For purposes herein, "solicit" 
      does not include broad-based recruiting efforts, including without 
      limitation help wanted advertising and posting of open positions on a party's 
      internet site. If You hire or engage directly or indirectly any

      (assuming 168 hours per month) for such personnel.

6. Reseller Orders. This Section applies if You purchase Products through an 
authorized reseller of WSO2 ("Reseller").

      terminate Your Subscription if WSO2 does not receive the corresponding payment 
      from the Reseller.

      6.2 Instead of an Order submitted to WSO2, Your order details will be as stated 
      in the order placed with WSO2 by the Reseller on Your behalf, 
      and the Reseller is responsible for the accuracy of any such order as 
      communicated to WSO2.

      6.3 If You are entitled to a refund under this Agreement, then unless otherwise 
      specified by WSO2, WSO2 will refund any applicable fees to the 
      Reseller and the Reseller will be solely responsible for refunding the 
      appropriate amounts to You.

      6.4 Resellers are not authorized to modify this Agreement or make any promises 
      or commitments on WSO2's behalf, and WSO2 is not bound by any 
      obligations to You other than as set forth in this Agreement.

      6.5 The amount paid or payable by the Reseller to WSO2 for Your use of the 
      applicable Software under this Agreement will be deemed the amount 
      actually paid or payable by You to WSO2 under this Agreement for purposes of 
      calculating the liability cap in Section 12.

8. Fees and Payment

      8.1 Fees. After You authorize an Order, upon renewal of a Subscription, or for 
      other fees due to WSO2, WSO2 will send you an invoice. You will pay 
      all fees specified in invoices. All payments are due within thirty (30) 
      calendar days of receipt of an invoice from WSO2 and are non-refundable. 
      WSO2 may suspend or cancel performance of all or part of the Subscription or 
      Services and may change its credit terms (after notifying You) if actual 
      payment is not received within sixty (60) calendar days of Your receipt of 
      WSO2's invoice. Payments past due sixty (60) calendar days will incur 
      interest at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the 
      highest rate permitted by law, whichever is less. In any proceeding brought 
      by WSO2 to collect amounts due, WSO2 will also receive its actual costs of 
      collection, including reasonable attorneys' fees.

      8.2 Taxes.  All fees are exclusive of any applicable Taxes. You will pay to 
      WSO2 an amount equal to any taxes arising from or relating to this 
      Agreement, including without limitation, sales, service, use or value added 
      taxes, which are paid by or are payable by WSO2. "Taxes" means any 
      form of taxation, levy, duty, customs fee, charge, contribution or impost of 
      whatever nature and by whatever authority imposed (including without 
      limitation any fine, penalty, surcharge or interest), excluding, however, any 
      taxes based solely on the net income of WSO2. If You are required 
      under any applicable law or regulation, domestic or foreign, to withhold or 
      deduct any portion of the payments due to WSO2, then the sum payable 
      to WSO2 will be increased by the amount necessary so that WSO2 receives an 
      amount equal to the sum it would have received had Subscriber made no 
      withholdings or deductions. 

      8.3 Purchase Orders. Any pre-printed terms on any purchase order that is issued 
      by You that are in addition to or in conflict with the terms of this 
      Agreement are null and void.

      14.9 Agreement to Governing Law and Dispute Resolution.  Each party agrees to 
      the applicable governing law above, and to the exclusive method 
      of dispute resolution. Where the applicable dispute resolution procedure is 
      arbitration, the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and 
      binding on the parties, and judgment may be entered in any court of competent 
      jurisdiction. Nothing in the above provision prevents either party 
      from applying to a court of competent jurisdiction for equitable or injunctive 
      relief. Any dispute or other action arising out of this Agreement 
      must be brought within one year of the date the cause of action accrued. An 
      action for nonpayment may be brought within two years of the date of 
      last payment.

      14.10 Regional Agreement Variations: WSO2 Australia Pty Limited. Based upon the 
      above, If You enter into this Agreement with WSO2 Australia Pty Limited, 
      Sections 4.8, 8.2, and 12 are replaced with the following:

            4.8 Remedies. IF ANY WARRANTY OR GUARANTEE CANNOT BE EXCLUDED AT LAW, THEN TO 
            THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WSO2'S SOLE LIABILITY AND SUBSCRIBER'S 
            SOLE REMEDY FOR BREACH OF A WARRANTY, GUARANTEE, OR OBLIGATION OF THIS 
            AGREEMENT IS LIMITED (AT WSO2'S OPTION) IN THE CASE OF: (A) SERVICES, TO 
            THE RESUPPLY OF THE SERVICES OR PAYMENT OF THE COST OF THE SAME; AND (B) GOODS 
            (INCLUDING SOFTWARE), TO THE REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT OF THE GOODS, 
            SUPPLY OF EQUIVALENT GOODS OR PAYMENT OF THE COST OF THE SAME. 

            8.2 Taxes. All fees are exclusive of any applicable Taxes. You will pay to WSO2 
            an amount equal to any taxes arising from or relating to this 
            Agreement, including without limitation, GST, use or value added taxes, which 
            are paid by or are payable by WSO2. "Taxes" means any form of 
            taxation, levy, duty, customs fee, charge, contribution or impost of whatever 
            nature and by whatever authority imposed (including without 
            limitation any fine, penalty, surcharge or interest), excluding, however, any 
            taxes based solely on the net income of WSO2. If You are required 
            under any applicable law or regulation, domestic or foreign, to withhold or 
            deduct any portion of the payments due to WSO2, then the sum payable 
            to WSO2 will be increased by the amount necessary so that WSO2 receives an 
            amount equal to the sum it would have received had Subscriber made no 
            withholdings or deductions.

            Where a supply under this Agreement is a taxable supply, all amounts payable or 
            other consideration provided must be increased by the amount of 
            GST payable in relation to the supply.  All GST must be paid at the time any 
            payment for any supply to which it relates is payable (provided a 
            valid tax invoice has been issued for the supply).  In this Section, "GST", 
            "tax invoice" and "taxable supply" have the meanings given to them 
            in the A New Tax Systems (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth).

            12. Limitation of Liability. EXCEPT FOR LIABILITY DAMAGES FOR BODILY INJURY 
            (INCLUDING DEATH) WHICH SHALL BE UNLIMITED, WSO2'S TOTAL AGGREGATE 
            LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, 
            REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), IS 
            LIMITED IN ANY CALENDAR YEAR TO THE AMOUNT PAID BY SUBSCRIBER FOR SERVICES 
            DURING  THAT CALENDAR YEAR. IF YOU HAVE PAID NO FEES, OR ARE A 
            NON-COMMERCIAL, EDUCATIONAL, OR TRIAL LICENSEE, WSO2'S MAXIMUM AGGREGATE 
            LIABILITY TO YOU IS $100.

            IN NO EVENT WILL WSO2 BE LIABLE FOR ANY "INDIRECT LOSSES" BEING: (A) DOWNTIME 
            COSTS, LOST BUSINESS, REVENUES, OR PROFITS, FAILURE TO REALIZE 
            EXPECTED SAVINGS OR OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF OR DAMAGE TO DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL OR 
            REPUTATION, COSTS OF SOFTWARE RESTORATION; AND (B) ANY LOSS 
            THAT DOES NOT ARISE NATURALLY OR ACCORDING TO THE USUAL COURSE OF THINGS FROM A 
            BREACH, ACT OR OMISSION RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT REGARDLESS 
            OF WHETHER ANY OF THE FOREGOING ARE FORESEEABLE, AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER WSO2 
            HAS BEEN NOTIFIED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING. 
            THESE LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY REGARDLESS OF THE BASIS OF LIABILITY, INCLUDING 
            NEGLIGENCE, MISREPRESENTATION, BREACH, DEFAMATION, INFRINGEMENT OF 
            PUBLICITY, PRIVACY, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, OR ANY OTHER CONTRACT OR 
            TORT CLAIM.

14.11 Regional Agreement Variations: WSO2 Germany GmbH. Based upon the above, 
If You enter into this Agreement with WSO2 Germany GmbH, 
Sections 5.5, 8.1, and 8.2 are replaced with the following:

            5.5 Non-solicitation. During the term of this Agreement and for a period of one 
            (1) year after its termination, neither party will directly 
            (a) solicit for hire or engagement any of the other party's personnel who were 
            involved in the provision or receipt of Services under this 
            Agreement or (b) hire or engage any person or entity who is or was employed or 
            engaged by the other party and who was involved in the provision 
            or receipt of Services under this Agreement until one hundred eighty (180) 
            calendar days following the termination of the person's or entity's 
            employment or engagement with the other party.

            For purposes herein, "solicit" does not include broad-based recruiting efforts, 
            including without limitation help wanted advertising and posting 
            of open positions on a party's internet site. If You hire or engage directly or 
            indirectly any personnel of WSO2 in violation of this section, 
            You will pay WSO2 a contractual penalty equal to three times the monthly 
            billing rate (assuming 168 hours per month) for such personnel.

            8.1 Fees. After You sign an Order, or upon renewal of a Subscription, WSO2 will 
            send you an invoice. You will pay all fees specified in invoices. 
            All payments are due within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of an invoice 
            from WSO2 and are non-refundable. WSO2 may suspend or cancel 
            performance of all or part of the Subscription or Services and may change its 
            credit terms (after notifying You) if actual payment is not 
            received within sixty (60) calendar days of Your receipt of WSO2's invoice. 
            Payments past due sixty (60) calendar days will incur interest at the 
            rate of 9 percentage points above the ECB basic interest rate per year. In 
            addition, Subscriber has to pay 40 EUR in recovering charges. In any 
            proceeding brought by WSO2 to collect amounts due, WSO2 will also receive its 
            actual costs of collection, including reasonable attorneys' fees.

            8.2 Taxes. All fees are exclusive of any applicable Taxes. You will pay to WSO2 
            an amount equal to any taxes arising from or relating to 
            this Agreement, including without limitation, VAT which is paid by or is 
            payable by WSO2. "Taxes" means any form of taxation, levy, duty, 
            customs fee, charge, contribution or impost of whatever nature and by whatever 
            authority imposed (including without limitation any fine, 
            penalty, surcharge or interest), excluding, however, any taxes based solely on 
            the net income of WSO2. If You are required under any applicable 
            law or regulation, domestic or foreign, to withhold or deduct any portion of 
            the payments due to WSO2, then the sum payable to WSO2 will be 
            increased by the amount necessary so that WSO2 receives an amount equal to the 
            sum it would have received had Subscriber made no withholdings 
            or deductions.
